Create a basic website display page

I managed to achieve all required goals (I hope) as well as 2 reach goals, those being a hover effect on buttons and a footer with social media icons and links.

I found CSS positioning in general quite difficult, although eventually I was able to get almost everything I envisioned working, aside from the header scrolling with the page. That is one thing I'd like help with.

I'd like feedback on pretty much everything, particularly the efficiency of my code, and general design feedback.
